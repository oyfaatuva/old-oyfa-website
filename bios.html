            Howdy, OYFA. My name is Taylor Mendoza, and I'm proud to serve as President for the 2021-2022 term. 
            I'm a fourth year majoring in Economics and Commerce and I'm from the best state in the DMV. 
            You can usually find me at the MSC, on the tennis courts, or occasionally in class. My hobbies 
            include spending time with my OYFAmily, collecting records, boarding of the snow and skate variety, 
            and appreciating nonstandard corporate architecture. I'm so excited to play a part in this amazing 
            organization in my last year at UVA, so looking forward to a great year!

            Hey guys!!!! I'm Arabella Chiang and I'm your Treasurer this year, so be on the 
            look out for those Venmo requests ;) I'm currently a 3rd year majoring in 
            Statistics and minoring in East Asian Studies. I was born in Montgomery, 
            Maryland, but was raised in Ashburn, VA, so I'm another NOVA kid here at UVA. 
            If anyone lives in NOVA and wants to hang out over breaks hit me up :))
            <br>
            Just a little about me, I love being on the go, so come out and adventure 
            with me. There's many mountains to hike and trails to walk in Cville! I also 
            love to just be around people and is always down to hang. I am a talker and 
            can talk your ear off, so if you're down to hang I'm here! I am also a huge 
            foodie, so come get food with me too. Maybe I'll cook, you never know. 
            <br>
            Anyways, I somehow found my way into OYFA my first year and was able to find 
            people who I call my best friends and practically my family. I remember being 
            hesitant in joining, until Sofia dragged me out to make Tiktoks with her and 
            then the rest was history!

          <p>
            Hi hi friends - My name is Sam Dioneda, and I'm a second year nursing student 
            serving as your Recording Secretary this school year. Outside of OYFA and being 
            a nursing student, I am apart of MAN and was an OL this summer, so hi if you 
            were an orientee of mine! When I'm not doing anything related to school or 
            OYFA, I love to bake, cook, eat sugar lol, run, read manga, and binge anime.
            <br>
            Besides the above, I also love to see people smile. Seeing people happy with 
            who they are and what they do is as addicting as sugar to me, and I always 
            strive to create that environment it whatever situation I am in.
            <br>
            As for OYFA, it may sound cliché, but OYFA has given me a home in the grand 
            place that is UVA, and I am eternally grateful for that. Coming in as a first 
            year during a pandemic was tough, but somehow, OYFA helped me grow in ways 
            I never imagined, try new things I never would have given thought to (like 
            dancing LOL), and let me meet and form friendships with people I will treasure 
            or the rest of my life. 
            <br>
            So enough of me already, we can talk about that another time. If you're reading 
            this and you're on the website... see you at OYFA events and I hope to get to 
            know you and see you smile :))

            the past 3 years, and I can't wait to make even more memories with you all this 
            year. outside of my academics, I enjoy being unapologetically myself, advocating 
            for mental health and wellness (which I have struggled with for almost a decade 
            so if you ever need someone to talk to I am always here!), and serving people 
            in my community. my other hobbies include cooking yummy vegan recipes, going on 
            hikes around the Blue Ridge area, tanning at the pool and beach, playing tennis, 
            and singing even though I have awful performance anxiety. hmu if you wanna be

            Hello hello, i'm Annie ! This is my first year on B&C but i'm beyond excited 
            to be one half of your historic chairs! I'm a 2nd year, hopeful GPH major with 
            a minor in Anthropology. I love film photography and learning languages (fun 
            fact: i'm currently learning my 5th and 6th languages). Another thing I love 
            doing is adding to +perfecting my coffee shop vibe playlist, so feel free to 
            send me any good rnb/krnb/chinese-rnb song recs :))

            Heyyy! I'm Franky, and studying makes up 80% of my personality (yeah, I
            follow study accounts on every social media platform), which is why I'm
            one of your advocacy chairs! I think education and staying informed is
            one of the most important things any individual can do for their community.
            The other 20% of my personality consists of constantly attempting to critique
            different media like a professional, upcycling/thrifting, and tennis. I also
            love cooking/baking and using my brain for anything >:D ! Feel free to hit
            me up if you ever want to rally or hold a verzuz, but just know that I'm
            always right...

            What's up everyone! I'm Jared and I'm going to be one of your webmasters this year. 
            I'm a third year studying biomedical engineer and still don't have a single clue of 
            what I'm doing after college. I enjoy: cooking, snowboarding, anime, volleyball, scary 
            movies, music and the limited edition lime straw from TroSmo (NOT Trop). 
            <br>
            I was lil late to the OYFA party and didn't join till my second semester of my 
            first year. Even with my "late" start everyone was so welcoming and genuine. 
            I quickly found my place at UVA within OYFA. So join ASAP! and come out to 
            our meetings and events, fill out the little form, go to that dance practice 
            even if you don't know anyone, the whole nine. I can't wait to meet you all.

            Hey everyone!  My name is Emil, a fourth year pre-med student majoring in Biology 
            and minoring in CS.  A little about me, I was born in Manila and lived there for 
            five years before my family moved to Virginia.  I have a boxer back at home, her 
            name is Allie.  I love her with all my heart; a fun fact about her is that she 
            sleeps like a human with her head always on a pillow and her bottom half under 
            blanket.  I like to play games--I recently migrated to PC gaming so woot woot.  
            Some of my favorite games include the Dark Souls trilogy, Destiny, and Valorant; 
            play with me some time!  Also if you like to play chess, add me on chess.com so 
            we can battle.  Anyway, I'm really excited to meet all of you this year, and I 
            can't wait to make memories with you all! :D

            I was born in Biñan, Laguna then moved to northern Virginia when I was 2 
            years old. I was grateful to grow up in such a diverse area in NOVA, but 
            it wasn’t until I joined OYFA that I became more in touch with my Filipino 
            roots. When I first came to UVA, I was really scared to be on my own for 
            the first time, but OYFA quickly became a home away from home. I love 
            having a community that I can share and appreciate my Filipino culture 
            with! &lt3

            Ever since I was a kid I was always attracted to creating and making. I taught 
            myself how to draw, paint, make jewelry, and have used creative writing as a 
            channel for self-expression as well! This outlet has helped me a lot with mental 
            health and personal growth/wellness, both of which I’m also really passionate 
            about. Every day I hope to share this with my communities and to open others 
            to their creative, freely expressive sides.
